Spring break... 
A time of fun... 
or at least it's supposed to be...


You walk to the side of the pool, Farid floating on his back in the water in front of you, 
"Hey, Farid, where's the bathroom? That punch went straight through me."

"Its over there, down the hallway." he blurts out, before he dives underwater.

You walk back into the mansion, following his instructions, and find the hallway, but something isnt adding up. 
There are multiple doors, each with a strange symbol on it. 
A voice whispers to you from out of nowhere, "Make your choice wisely, for you cannot turn back."
The symbols on each door start to glow, and you feel something pulling you towards them, beckoning for you to open one. 

Choose wisely...
